# Schlossgespenst AIs  

This mod offers twelve completely new AIs to provide variety in skirmishes, each of them with its own character and style.

### New and old characters

You will find **interpretations of historical figures** such as *Jeanne d'Arc*, *Guilhabert de Castres* or *Kılıç Arslan I.*, **known characters** like *Lord Woolsack* and the *Schlossgespenst* and **new characters** such as the *Bandit* or the *Demon*.

All of the up to four new castles of the AIs, as well as their strategy and character, were thought up and created by me. The portraits, videos and voices are put together from parts of other games, images and the like. All voice and text files are in german.
