# Schlossgespenst AIs  
Twelve new AIs, to mix things up a bit. Seven are interpretations of historical figures like Jeanne d'Arc or Kilij Arslan, some of them well known, some not so much, three generic ones, like a Bandit and to top it off, Lord Woolsack from Stronghold 1 and the Schlossgespenst.

Here in my preferred configuration.
